The Dataset consists of 8 columns ['gender', 'race/ethnicity', 'parental level of education', 'lunch',
       'test preparation course', 'math score', 'reading score',
       'writing score']
-And one added column  'overall_score' which consists of the average of the 3 scores math,reading and writing.


## Summary of Findings

> Males has better performance on math field, but worse on reading and writing.
> Students who had the standard lunch had an average overall score greater than those with free/reduced lunch, and also had a narrower grades distribuation.
>The average scores tend to be higher with those who completed a test preparation course. Also The score distribution gets narrower if students complete the preparation course before test
> Females tend to have a slightly higher average overall score with a narrower distribution and higher outliers count but overall it's not big enough to claim that gender really affects overall students scores.
> reading and writing scores has a postive correlation which means that students with high reading/ writing scores tend to have a high writing/reading scores also.
> math scores and writing scores has a postive correlation with a distrubation peeks usually between 60 and 80.
> the higher the parents education level the higher the student overall scores gets.
> Group E has the highest mean overall scores and the smalles distribuation area
> Males Tend to have a higher mean overall score in group A and D but Females scores tend to be higher is groups A,B and E
